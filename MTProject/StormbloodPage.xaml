Not only is Zenos still out there, but the creator of the Ultima Weapon, Gaius, is also alive and seeking vengeance on the Ascians who betrayed him. During a meeting to discuss the possibility of Ascian manipulations, half of the Scions are afflicted with a psychic calling that leaves them comatose."  Style="{StaticResource bodyStyle}"></Label>
